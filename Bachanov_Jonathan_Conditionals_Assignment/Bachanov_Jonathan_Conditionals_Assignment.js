 we	have	covered	in	class	and	not	the	same	as	any	of	your	other	projects.
     Keep	in	mind	that	your	final	project	must	contain the	following:
     a. An	example	of	2 different	arithmetic	operators (addition	and subtraction,
     addition	and multiplication,	subtraction	and division,	etc.).
 b. 2	conditional	statements	â€“ A	least	one	must	contain	an	else	if	statement
  c. At	least	1	ternary	conditional	statement	must	be	used
 d. At	least	1	Logical	Operator	&&	,	||	or	!
     e. Must	contain	at	least	3	user	prompts	that	are	used	in	calculations
 f. All	prompts	must	be	validated
